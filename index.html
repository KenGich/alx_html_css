        <article> <h3> HTML PROJECT</h3> </article>
                 <P> <a href="#Project Desicription" target="_blank">Project Description</a></P>
                 <p>I am currently undertaking a learning project in HTML, focusing on the fundamental aspects of web development. This project involves creating a 
                    personal website that includes a home page, about page, projects page, and contact page. Through this hands-on experience, I am gaining a solid 
                    understanding of HTML syntax, elements, attributes, and semantic markup.</p>
        <article> <h3> CSS PROJECT</h3> </article>
                  <P> <a href="#Project Desicription" target="_blank">Project Description</a></P>
                  <p>This project involves enhancing the personal website I created with HTML by applying various CSS techniques to improve layout, typography, color schemes, and responsiveness.
                        The impact of this project is substantial, as it equips me with essential skills to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. 
                        By mastering CSS, I am able to control the design aspects of web development, ensuring that the websites I create are both aesthetically pleasing 
                        and functional across different devices and screen sizes.</p>
        <article> <h3> PROTOTYPES & WIREFRAMES </h3> </article>
                 <P> <a href="#Project Desicription" target="_blank"> Project Description </a> </P>
                 <p>This project involves sketching wireframes to outline the basic structure and flow of user interfaces, followed by developing interactive prototypes 
                    to simulate user interactions. The impact of this project is profound, as it provides a solid foundation for designing intuitive and user-centered 
                    interfaces. By mastering wireframing, I can effectively plan and communicate design concepts, ensuring a clear and organized layout before actual 
                    development.</p>
